    title: "Poached Pear Earl Gray Loaf",
    ingredients: [
      `4 cups water`,
      `5 Earl Grey tea bags, or 5 tsp loose leaf Earl grey tea`,
      `1 cup sugar`,
      `3 medium peeled pears`,
      `1-⅓ cup (200 g) all-purpose flour`,
      `½ cup (50 g) cocoa powder`,
      `1 teaspoon baking soda`,
      `½ teaspoon salt`,
      `⅔ cup (165 ml) milk`,
      `⅓ cup (75 g) yogurt`,
      `½ cup (113 g) room temperature butter`,
      `1 cup (200 g) brownsugar`,
      `2 large eggs`,
    ],
    serving_size: "1 loaf",
    steps: [
      "First, poach the pears. Bring the water to a boil on the stovetop in a medium-sized pot. Add the Earl Grey tea bags or leaves and turn down the heat. Let the tea steep in the boiling water for 5 minutes to infuse. Remove the tea bags, add the sugar to the pot, and stir to dissolve.",
      "Add the peeled pears to the pot. Turn up the heat to medium-high and bring the tea back to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and let the pears simmer for 20 to 25 minutes until tender. Once the pears are tender, carefully remove them from the pot and set them aside on a plate or in a bowl to cool.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350°F (180ºC). Grease a loaf tin lightly with butter. Line the pan with a parchment paper sling with overhang on both sides.",
      "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt.",
      "Mix the milk and yogurt in another bowl until smooth.",
      "Using a hand or stand mixer beat the butter until light and fluffy, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the brown sugar and continue to mix a few minutes more.",
      "Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix until well incorporated.",
      "Add in half of the flour mixture and half of the milk mixture. Mix everything together on low speed until well incorporated. Add in the remaining flour and milk mixtures and continue to mix on low speed until the chocolate batter is just combined.",
      "Add a few spoonfuls of batter to the bottom of the prepared loaf tin. Place the poached pears, bottom side down in the batter. Spoon the remaining chocolate batter around the three pears. Bake the loaf for 50 to 55 minutes, or until the top springs gently back when touched, then transfer it to a wire cooling rack. Let the loaf cool for 20 minutes, then remove it from the tin. Cool the loaf completely before slicing."
